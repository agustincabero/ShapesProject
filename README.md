# ShapesProject
This Java project is a comprehensive exploration of fundamental object-oriented programming principles, focusing on interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation.

The core features of this project include:

Interfaces: The Shape interface sets the blueprint for all shapes by defining essential methods like calculateArea() and calculatePerimeter().

Inheritance: Abstract classes like TwoDimensionalShape and ThreeDimensionalShape serve as foundational classes for specific shapes, offering shared functionalities and methods.

Polymorphism: Concrete shape classes such as Circle, Square, Sphere, and Cube implement interface methods or inherited abstract class methods, showcasing varied implementations based on each shape's unique characteristics.

Abstraction: Abstract classes TwoDimensionalShape and ThreeDimensionalShape provide a level of abstraction, outlining common behaviors without detailing specific implementation intricacies.

Encapsulation: Each class encapsulates its data (e.g., radius for Circle, side for Square) and behaviors (e.g., calculateArea() and calculatePerimeter() methods), concealing internal details and providing a clear, standardized interface for interacting with objects.

This project serves as an educational resource for Java developers seeking to grasp object-oriented programming principles and practices. It demonstrates how to create modular, reusable, and maintainable code by leveraging these foundational concepts. Explore and enhance your understanding of Java's OOP paradigm with this versatile Shapes Library.
